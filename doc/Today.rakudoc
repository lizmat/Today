=head1 NAME

Today - provide a 'today' term

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Today;

say today;  # 2024-06-25

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Raku provides a C<now> term to get an C<Instant> object of the current time.
Oddly enough, an associated C<today> term is absent.  This module provides
that.  Should future versions of Raku provide that term out of the box, then
using this module will become a no-op.
