Today - provide a 'today' term

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Today;

say today;  # 2024-06-25
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Raku provides a `now` term to get an `Instant` object of the current time. Oddly enough, an associated `today` term is absent. This module provides that. Should future versions of Raku provide that term out of the box, then using this module will become a no-op.
